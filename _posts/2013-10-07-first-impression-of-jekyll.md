I spent tonight diving into Jekyll and Liquid templates and I have to say, how in the heck did I not know about this before tonight??

The whole setup is amazingly simple. I've used a lot of technologies and CMS's to build websites in the past but the learning curve for them is generally steep. It takes a full week to really understand the basics of a CMS like WordPress or Drupal and much longer to do anything custom in the system. Jekyll and Liquid as a template engine has been really easy to understand and setup and part of that may be because Github pages support it by default. Going forward I may write a basic tutorial on how to setup a portfolio and blog using what I learned tonight.
