I spent tonight diving into Jekyll and Liquid templates and I have to say, how in the heck did I not know about these things before tonight?? I've heard of "Jenkins" (which I initially confused with Jekyll) for continuous integration. I wonder if there are any similarities between the two.

The whole setup is amazingly simple. I've used a lot of technologies and CMS's to build websites in the past but the learning curve for all of them has been really steep. It takes a full week to really understand the basics of a CMS like WordPress or Drupal and much longer to do anything custom in the system (which is probably great for a company that bills for projects by the hour). Jekyll and Liquid as a template engine has been really easy to understand and setup and part of that may be because Github pages support it by default. Going forward I may write a basic tutorial on how to setup a portfolio and blog using what I learned tonight. And hopefully I can find a client or work project that I can use it on too because I've really enjoyed using it so far.
