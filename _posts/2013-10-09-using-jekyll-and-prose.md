description: How to use Jekyll
---

It was just yesterday that I learned about Jekyll as a blog platform. All I want to do right now is experiment with Jekyll and continue converting my portfolio. Due to being restricted in my technology stack at work, using Jekyll with Prose and Github is my escape from the dull projects and into something new (at least to me) and exciting.

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a Ruby Gem that converts plain text to static websites. The default setup for a website using Jekyll does a good job in templating the website so you can reuse pieces where ever they're needed. I've been a big fan of object oriented CSS and attempting to abstract code bits into the simplest, most reusable way. The template system that Jekyll encourages help to keep things modular in this way.

[Prose](http://prose.io/ "Prose") is a content editor for Github. The editor has a very simple and clean interface with limited options compared to the rich text editor (rte) in WordPress or Drupal. I consider this a huge benefit. I've never liked the rte in WordPress because it has too many options. More often than not, a content editor will screw up the look and feel of the site by getting too overly "creative" with the buttons in the editor. For consistency sake and for the overall appearance of a website, having fewer options is better.

It is really nice that I don't have to worry about the rte creating extra paragraph tags, inline styles, or other unnecessary markup or just bugging out all together. Just good ol' plain text using Markdown. It's a refreshing change of pace! That has been my biggest hurdle with other editors and I have wasted countless hours in frustration dealing with glitches and fixing improper markup.

I look forward to working more with this soon.
