I spent tonight diving into Jekyll and Liquid templating and I have to say, how in the heck did I not know about these things before tonight?? I think I've heard the term "Jekyll" used at work before and I understood it to be a tool for continuous deployments. A developer would commit code to a repository, Jekyll would be watching for changes on the files and if there was a change, it would trigger a build process to update the development server for testing.

The whole setup is amazingly simple. I've used a plethora of technologies and CMS's to build websites in the past but the learning curve for all of them has been really steep. It takes a full week to really understand the basics of a CMS like WordPress or Drupal and much longer if someone wants to do anything custom in the system. Jekyll and Liquid as a templating engine has been really easy to understand and setup and part of that may be because Github pages support it by default. Going forward I may write a basic tutorial on how to setup a portfolio and blog using what I learned tonight. And hopefully I can find a client or work project that I can use it on too because I see this as the way to develop websites in the near future.
