## Using Jekyll and Prose

It was just yesterday that I learned about Jekyll as a blogging platform. All I want to do right now is experiment with Jekyll and continue converting my portfolio to this platform. [Begin rant] Most of the work I've done over the last year has been on top of crappy CMS code written with poor HTML structure and overly specific CSS selectors. It's even worse than dealing with legacy code. There is no reason in this day and age to have such terrible code bases on the web. Sure we all have deadlines to push projects out the door but when you are building a central code base that will need to be maintained for years to come and developers are building dozens of projects on top of that central code base, then you should take the time to build it right the first time or at the very least work iteratively to improve it. [End rant] After a while it gets exhausting to deal with and it's not any fun. Using Jekyll with Prose and Github is my escape from the dull projects and into something new (at least to me) and exciting.

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a Ruby Gem that converts plain text to static websites. The default setup for a website using Jekyll does a good job in templating the website so you can reuse pieces whereever they're needed. I've been a big fan of object oriented css, OOCSS (coined by [Nicole Sullivan](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/) ) and attempting to abstract code bits into the simplest, most reusable way. The templated system that Jekyll encourages help to keep things modular in this way.

[Prose](http://prose.io/ "Prose") is a content editor for Github. The editor has a very simple and clean interface with limited options compared to the rich text editor (rte) in WordPress or Drupal. I consider this a huge benefit. I've never liked the rte in WordPress because it has too many options. More often than not, a content editor will screw up the look and feel of the site by getting too overly "creative" with the buttons in the editor. For consistency sake and for the overall appearance of a website, having fewer options is better.

It is really nice that I don't have to worry about the rte creating extra paragraph tags, inline styles, or other unneccessary markup or just bugging out all together. Just good ole plain text using Markdown. It's a refreshing change of pace! That has been my biggest hurdle with other editors and I have wasted countless hours in frustration dealing with glitches and fixing improper markup.

I look forward to working more with this soon.
