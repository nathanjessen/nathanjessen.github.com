          <p>Heylo! I am Nathan Jessen, a Front-end Architect based in Las Vegas. I love minimal design, clean code, and high performance web sites. Specialized in CSS development, I always try to enhance the developer experience through Styleguide driven development and well-architected code bases. I also try to enhance the user experience using smooth animations, simple navigation, and beautiful designs. I'm continually learning new things and enjoy speaking to/with others who are also passionate of their craft.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>I try to find time to develop my own projects on the side and contribute to open-source projects on GitHub.</li>
            <li>Passion for problem-solving and developing new ways to approach an issue</li>
            <li>Able to balance thinking about the big picture and the small details</li>
            <li>Curiosity when code doesn't work. Willingness to digging to the root of an issue to fix it rather than piling on temporary hacks</li>
            <li>Comfortable asking superiors, clients, or peers for additional information to ensure expectations and requirements are understood</li>
            <li>Willing to experiment with new technologies and approaching a project or task in a new way</li>
            <li>Empathetic to the client and user of a website. I will constantly ask myself if what I'm building is valuable to the client and its users or if something needs altered to better meet their needs and expectations</li>
            <li>Able to switch gears when the scope of a project changes unexpectedly or time sensitive issues arise</li>
            <li>Value my own set of problem-solving abilities and best practices instead of always following set rules and practices that may be out of date</li>
            <li>High level of communication after several years working remote</li>
          </ol>
