		<h3>{{ page.title }}</h3>
		<p>I am a 26 year old Interactive Front-end Developer from Blair, NE but currently living in Kansas City, MO. I work for an amazing company, <a href="//www.vml.com/">VML</a>.</p>

		<h3>What I do</h3>
		<p><b>Front-end Development</b> (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript). I take pride in writing modern, high-performing websites that are easy to maintain and scale. I'm a big fan of Grunt/Gulp, Sass, and any tool that helps to automate a lot of the busy work and sculpt a clean code base.</p>

		<h3>What I do not do</h3>
		<p><b>Countless revisions</b>. Take time to develop your concept and time frame. When I start the work, you can expect a quick turn around. Once I have completed the work, I will allow for two rounds of revisions to ensure we are both happy with the final product. Anything beyond two revisions is indicative of something that wasn't addressed before the concept handoff. This will also avoid high invoices and bad moods on both sides.</p>
		<p>If you need to rely on very old browsers and want to include stuff like Flash, I clearly am the wrong person to hire. IE8+ only, please.</p>

		<h3>Other Considerations</h3>
		<p>I provide <b>high quality work</b> and I work fast, my hourly rates are based on this to be fair to both of us.</p>
		<p>Consider a proper time frame that is doable for you and me. If I don't receive the necessary deliverables on time, the agreed upon project deadline will be void and will need to be readdressed to ensure I have enough time to do the development.</p>
