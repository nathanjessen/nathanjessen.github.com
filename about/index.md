## About

I am a 26 year old Interactive Front-end Developer from Blair, NE but currently living in Kansas City, MO. I work for an amazing company, [VML](//www.vml.com/).


## What I do

- **Front-end Development** (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript). I take pride in writing modern, high-performing websites that are easy to maintain and scale. I'm a big fan of Grunt, SASS, and any tool that helps to automate a lot of the busy work and sculp a clean codebase.


## What I do not do

- **Countless revisions**. Take your time to develop your concept and time frame. When I start the work, you can expect a quick turn around. Once I have completed the work, I will allow for two rounds of revisions to ensure we are both happy with the final product. Anything beyond two revisions is indicative of something that wasn't addressed before the concept handoff. This will also avoid high invoices and bad moods on both sides.
- If you need to rely on very old browsers and want to include stuff like Flash, I clearly am the wrong person to hire. My day job requires I support IE7+ but I will not support IE7 with side projects. IE8+ only, please.


## Other Considerations

- I provide **high quality work** and work fast, my hourly rates are based on this to be fair to both of us.

- Consider a proper timeframe that is doable for you and me. If I don't receive the necessary deliverables on time, the agreed upon project deadline will be void and will need to be readdressed to ensure I have enough time to do the development.


## Dear Recruiters,

I am always open to new opportunities but be sure the opportunity fits me well and the pay is competitive. I am open to relocation if assistance is provided.

I will only consider positions in front-end development that allow me to work with the latest front end technologies (Git, SASS, Grunt, HTML5, CSS3, etc). If you send me an opportunity that is clearly for a backend developer or doesn't meet the above requirements, your email will be deleted, marked as spam, and you will be added to an email blacklist.

With that in mind, I am happy to speak with you about relevant opportunities.
